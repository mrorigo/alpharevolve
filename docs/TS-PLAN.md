AlphaEvolve is a significant advancement in AI-driven algorithm design, leveraging the power of Google's Gemini large language models (LLMs) within an evolutionary framework to discover and optimize complex algorithms for both theoretical and practical applications. Its ability to generate and evaluate code automatically, coupled with an evolutionary process, allows it to make substantial progress in diverse fields, including computer science, mathematics, and optimizing large-scale computing infrastructure.

Main Themes:

AI-powered Algorithm Discovery and Optimization: AlphaEvolve represents a novel approach to algorithm design, combining the creative generation capabilities of LLMs with rigorous automated evaluation and an evolutionary process to iteratively improve solutions. This moves beyond simply generating code to actively discovering and refining algorithms for complex problems.
Leveraging Gemini Models: AlphaEvolve utilizes an ensemble of Gemini models (Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro) to maximize both the breadth of ideas explored and the depth of insightful suggestions for algorithmic solutions.
Automated Evaluation and Evolutionary Framework: A core component of AlphaEvolve is its use of automated evaluators to verify, run, and score proposed programs based on objective metrics. This data is then used within an evolutionary algorithm to determine which programs are most promising and should be used for future iterations.
Impact on Google's Infrastructure: AlphaEvolve has been successfully deployed within Google's computing ecosystem, demonstrably improving the efficiency of data centers, assisting in hardware design (specifically TPUs), and enhancing AI training and inference processes.
Advancing Mathematical and Algorithmic Frontiers: Beyond practical applications within Google, AlphaEvolve has shown significant promise in advancing fundamental research in mathematics and computer science, discovering new algorithms for matrix multiplication and making progress on long-standing open problems like the kissing number problem.
Potential for Broad Application: The general nature of AlphaEvolve suggests its applicability extends beyond computing and mathematics to areas like material science, drug discovery, sustainability, and other technological and business domains where solutions can be described as verifiable algorithms.

Drawing upon the sources and our previous discussion, here is a plan for implementing a minimal AlphaEvolve system in TypeScript, focused on using the OpenAI Chat Completion API and keeping the complexity low (no concurrency, minimal evolutionary logic initially).

This plan follows the high-level components identified in the AlphaEvolve design but adapts them for a simpler implementation context.

**Core Concepts from Sources to Implement:**

*   **Evolutionary Coding Agent**: The system should iteratively improve code based on feedback.
*   **LLM Interaction**: Leverage an LLM (specifically, we'll use OpenAI as requested) to generate code proposals. The sources mention using an ensemble of Gemini models (Flash for breadth, Pro for depth), but for minimality, we'll use a single model.
*   **Automated Evaluation**: Programs must be verifiable and scoreable using automated metrics. This evaluation provides objective, quantifiable assessment.
*   **Program Database**: Store generated programs and their evaluation results. The sources describe an evolutionary algorithm here, but for minimality, we'll use a simpler program selection/storage.
*   **Iterative Loop**: The process involves sampling programs, prompting the LLM, generating new code, evaluating it, and updating the database.
*   **Code Modification**: The LLM can propose changes as diffs (`<<<<<<< SEARCH`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> REPLACE`) or output full blocks.

**Implementation Plan Steps (Minimal TypeScript):**

1.  **Set up Project and Dependencies**:
    *   Initialize a Node.js project with TypeScript.
    *   Install necessary dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `openai` (or a similar library for OpenAI API interaction), and potentially a utility for applying diffs if not implementing manually.

2.  **Define Core Data Structures (TypeScript Interfaces)**:
    *   `Program`: An interface to hold a program's code (`string`) and its evaluation score(s) (`number | { [metric: string]: number }`). Based on the sources, AlphaEvolve can optimize multiple metrics.
    *   `ProblemConfig`: An interface for user input, including:
        *   `initialCode: string`: The starting program code [Input section of pseudocode, 23].
        *   `evaluationFunction: (code: string) => number | { [metric: string]: number }`: A TypeScript function provided by the user to evaluate a program. This simulates the "Automated Evaluators Pool" and "Evaluation Code" components [Input section of pseudocode, 5, 18, 21, 33].
        *   `problemDescription: string`: A natural language description of the task [Input section of pseudocode, 19].
        *   `iterations: number`: A simple termination criterion (number of evolutionary steps) [Input section of pseudocode].
        *   `llmModel: string`: The specific OpenAI model to use.
        *   `promptTemplate: string`: A template for constructing the LLM prompt.
    *   `ProgramDatabase`: A simple class or object holding an array of `Program` instances. Include methods to `addProgram(program: Program, results: EvaluationResults)` and `sampleProgram(): Program` (e.g., just return the highest-scoring program found so far, or a random one from the top N).

3.  **Implement the Automated Evaluator (Simulated)**:
    *   This is represented by the `evaluationFunction` passed in `ProblemConfig`. The main loop will simply call this user-provided function with the generated code string.
    *   *Important:* For a real system, this would involve sandboxing and running code, but for minimality, we rely on a provided function that *represents* this evaluation. This function must return quantifiable metrics.

4.  **Implement the LLM Interaction Module**:
    *   Create a function, e.g., `generateCode(prompt: string, model: string): Promise<string>`.
    *   Use the OpenAI library to make an API call to the specified model (`model` from `ProblemConfig`) with the constructed `prompt`.
    *   Handle the API response, extracting the generated text.

5.  **Implement the Prompt Sampler**:
    *   Create a function, e.g., `buildPrompt(config: ProblemConfig, programDatabase: ProgramDatabase): string`.
    *   This function will select a program from the `programDatabase` (e.g., the current best program based on score).
    *   Construct the prompt string for the LLM. This prompt should include:
        *   System instructions (e.g., "Act as an expert software developer...").
        *   The problem description [Input section of pseudocode, 19].
        *   The code of the sampled "parent" program.
        *   Instructions on how to propose changes (e.g., using the diff format or outputting the full block).
        *   Optionally, information about the performance of previous programs as "rich context" or "inspiration".
        *   Use the `promptTemplate` from the config for structure.

6.  **Implement the Code Modification Application**:
    *   Create a function, e.g., `applyChanges(parentCode: string, generatedText: string): string`.
    *   This function needs to parse the `generatedText` from the LLM.
    *   Check if it follows the diff format (`<<<<<<< SEARCH`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> REPLACE`).
    *   If it's a diff, find the `SEARCH` block in the `parentCode` and replace it with the `REPLACE` block.
    *   If it's a full code block (detected by configuration or parsing), replace the appropriate marked section (`# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START`/`# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`) in the `parentCode`.
    *   Return the new `childCode`.

7.  **Implement the Main Evolutionary Loop (Simplified Controller)**:
    *   Create an `async` function, e.g., `runAlphaEvolve(config: ProblemConfig)`.
    *   **Initialization**:
        *   Initialize the `programDatabase`.
        *   Evaluate the `config.initialCode` using the `config.evaluationFunction`.
        *   Add the initial program and its results to the `programDatabase` [Step 1 & 2 in pseudocode].
    *   **Evolutionary Loop**: Use a `for` loop iterating `config.iterations` times [Step 2 in pseudocode].
        *   Inside the loop:
            *   Call `programDatabase.sampleProgram()` to get a parent program.
            *   Call `buildPrompt()` to create the LLM prompt.
            *   Call `generateCode()` to get the LLM's proposed changes.
            *   Call `applyChanges()` to create the new `childProgram`.
            *   Evaluate the `childProgram` using `config.evaluationFunction` to get `results`.
            *   Call `programDatabase.addProgram(childProgram, results)` to store the new program and its evaluation.
    *   **Output**: After the loop, retrieve the best program from the `programDatabase` (e.g., the one with the highest primary score) and return it [Output section of pseudocode, 22].

8.  **Add Entry Point and Example Usage**:
    *   Include a simple main block or function to set up a `ProblemConfig` with example code and an evaluation function.
    *   Call `runAlphaEvolve` with the config and print the result.

This plan provides a basic framework where the core cycle of generating code via an LLM, evaluating it, and using those results to inform future generations is present, albeit in a simplified, single-process implementation. The complexity of the "evolutionary algorithm" in the database and the sophistication of the "Automated Evaluators Pool" are reduced for this minimal version, relying on simple storage and a user-provided evaluation function.
